Cargo
-----
- cargo new --bin/--lib
	- default: bin
	- Cargo.toml, 
	- lib: lib.rs, ignore Cargo.lock -> warum??
	- bin: main.rs, Cargo.lock nicht ignoriert

Errors
-----
- bad/inscrutable error message:
	- report an issue at rust-lang/rust
	- special tag for those issues
	- it may take some time for someone to react (there are a LOT of open compiler issues!), but they are appreciated and will be processed eventually
